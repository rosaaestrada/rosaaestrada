## Projects
**Thesis | Predicting What Factors Influence Loan Default in the U.S.**
- Implemented Advanced Machine Learning techniques on The LendingClub and The Federal Emergency Management Agency datasets to predict what factors influence loan default.
- Employed methods such as feature engineering, feature selection, Logistic Regression Random Forest, and Decision Tree models.
- Enhanced prediction accuracy through rigorous data preprocessing and feature importance analysis, optimizing model performance and uncovering key insights into loan default prediction trends.
- Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn, and Scikit-Learn) to implement a comprehensive data science pipeline, resulting in actionable insights into loan default prediction and financial decision-making implications.
- Identified ‚Äòlast_pymnt_amnt‚Äô as the top predictor, indicating that higher last payment amounts are associated with a lower likelihood of default, underscoring its role in reducing default risk.

**Mental Health & Age Analysis Among U.S. Adults in 2018**
- Conducted statistical analysis on the BRFSS 2018 dataset to examine the relationship between mental health and age among U.S. adults aged 18-55+, utilizing techniques such as Pearson Chi-Square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Confusion Matrix.
- Employed Python and followed a structured data science pipeline to analyze and identify the patterns in mental health days reported across different age groups.
- Identified adults aged 55+ reported the highest number of ‚Äúno good‚Äù mental health days, leveraging Pearson Chi-Square results, indicating a significant association between age and mental health outcomes.
- Uncovered further insights by establishing significant correlations between mental health and variables such as general health, education level, and veteran status, highlighting their impact on mental well-being.

**GDP Growth Rate Prediction for USA, Finland, and Denmark**
- Applied Advanced Machine Learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to analyze historical data from the World Happiness Report from 2015-2024 to predict which country among the USA, Finland, and Denmark will likely experience higher GDP growth in 2025.
- Implemented detailed feature engineering and data preprocessing methods to enhance model accuracy and ensure its reliability.
- Evaluated model performance using R-squared values, providing evidence-based insights into the economic trajectories of these countries, highlighting Denmark‚Äôs potential for higher GDP growth rates in 2025.
- Demonstrated proficiency in utilizing happiness metrics and machine learning techniques for precise economic forecasting, supporting data-driven policy formulation and strategic decision-making.
