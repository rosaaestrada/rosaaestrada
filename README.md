## Projects
**Thesis | Predicting What Factors Influence Loan Default in the United States using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**
- Implemented Advanced Machine Learning techniques on The LendingClub and The Federal Emergency Management Agency datasets to investigate loan default factors, employing methods such as feature engineering, feature selection, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models.  
- Utilized Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn, and Scikit-Learn for data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, predictive modeling, and model evaluation, resulting in valuable insights into loan default prediction and financial decision-making implications.

**Mental Health & Age | Analyzing the Relationship Between Mental Health & Age Among U.S. Adults in 2018**
- Conducted statistical analysis on the BRFSS 2018 dataset to examine the correlation between mental health and age among U.S. adults aged 18-55+, employing techniques such as Pearson Chi-Square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Confusion Matrix.
- Explored what ages reported having more ‚Äúnot good‚Äù mental health days while controlling for variables including general health, education level, and veteran status, providing insights into age groups most vulnerable to mental health concerns and informing targeted intervention strategies.

**GDP Growth Rate & USA, Finland, and Denmark | Predicting What Countries Will Experience Higher GDP Growth Rates in 2025**
- Utilized historical data from the World Happiness Report from 2015 to 2024 and employed Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict which country among the USA, Finland, and Denmark will likely experience higher GDP growth in 2025.
- Performed model evaluation using R-squared values to assess the accuracy between the model‚Äôs predictions and actual GDP growth rates, resulting in Denmark having the highest R-squared values, indicating stronger correlation than the USA and Finland
